# 4. How order emerges in non-equilibrium systems

<br>`(00:00)` uh the last couple of lectures were
<br>`(00:02)` quite
<br>`(00:03)` technical right and uh
<br>`(00:06)` so we introduced uh concepts from
<br>`(00:08)` stochastic processes the launch of the
<br>`(00:10)` equation
<br>`(00:11)` uh the master equation are the different
<br>`(00:14)` ways to describe the time evolution of
<br>`(00:16)` stochastic processes
<br>`(00:17)` and then the last lecture was pretty
<br>`(00:19)` tough you know so
<br>`(00:21)` last the last lecture we introduced a
<br>`(00:23)` few theory description
<br>`(00:25)` of these processes and probably many of
<br>`(00:28)` you
<br>`(00:29)` who didn't hear that before were quite
<br>`(00:32)` have had
<br>`(00:32)` quite a hard time the good news is that
<br>`(00:35)` we don't
<br>`(00:36)` use that for now we use it later in the
<br>`(00:39)` lecture
<br>`(00:40)` but for today you know we won't use that
<br>`(00:42)` and actually
<br>`(00:44)` you'll be pretty fine with school
<br>`(00:46)` mathematics for today's lecture
<br>`(00:49)` yeah so so now that we've
<br>`(00:53)` covered the
<br>`(00:56)` technical the methodology power let's go
<br>`(00:58)` into some physics
<br>`(01:00)` and try to understand how actually order
<br>`(01:03)` emerges
<br>`(01:04)` in uh complex systems and
<br>`(01:06)` non-equilibrium systems
<br>`(01:08)` yeah and share the um
<br>`(01:20)` here we go
<br>`(01:29)` okay

### slide 1

<br>`(01:36)` here we go now you can see my very
<br>`(01:38)` sophisticated slides
<br>`(01:40)` yeah and uh so what do we mean by order
<br>`(01:44)` actually what do we actually i don't
<br>`(01:45)` want to understand we can talk about
<br>`(01:47)` order
<br>`(01:48)` yeah so this lecture so there are
<br>`(01:50)` different kinds of order
<br>`(01:52)` and this lecture i'll be talking about
<br>`(01:53)` __polar order__ polar order is order
<br>`(01:56)` of direction now so which direction are
<br>`(01:59)` you going which directions are polymers
<br>`(02:02)` pointing
<br>`(02:03)` which directions are spins pointing
<br>`(02:06)` which directions are fish swimming and
<br>`(02:10)` so on
<br>`(02:10)` now that's polar order and here you can
<br>`(02:13)` see
<br>`(02:14)` two examples of polar order now on the
<br>`(02:17)` left hand side so i took a picture from
<br>`(02:18)` north korea assuming that nobody from
<br>`(02:20)` north korea is joining
<br>`(02:22)` us and i'm actually not offended
<br>`(02:24)` offending anybody
<br>`(02:25)` you know so this is a thing to promote
<br>`(02:28)` from north korea and
<br>`(02:30)` you can very clearly see polar order
<br>`(02:33)` in these soldiers and in the face of
<br>`(02:34)` these soldiers yeah is that
<br>`(02:37)` is that the job of a physicist to
<br>`(02:40)` understand that
<br>`(02:42)` yeah probably not yeah probably this
<br>`(02:44)` polar order
<br>`(02:45)` in this picture on the left hand side
<br>`(02:48)` has a very
<br>`(02:49)` simple origin yeah and this very simple
<br>`(02:51)` origin is
<br>`(02:52)` that somebody is probably sitting there
<br>`(02:55)` some president or so
<br>`(02:57)` yeah sitting there on the left hand side
<br>`(02:59)` and somebody is telling them to look at
<br>`(03:01)` this direction
<br>`(03:03)` yeah and so this is not what we want to
<br>`(03:05)` understand as physicists yeah that's
<br>`(03:07)` pretty we kind of know why they're
<br>`(03:09)` looking in that direction
<br>`(03:10)` you know the tv camera would zoom out
<br>`(03:12)` we'll probably see somebody
<br>`(03:14)` important uh sitting there so that's
<br>`(03:17)` that's not what we mean and that's
<br>`(03:18)` the reason it's not self-organized
<br>`(03:20)` there's somebody
<br>`(03:22)` who tells uh these soldiers where to
<br>`(03:25)` look
<br>`(03:26)` and uh now compare that to the
<br>`(03:30)` picture on the right-hand side
<br>`(03:33)` you know that's also an example of polar
<br>`(03:35)` order there's also an example of
<br>`(03:37)` a flock like a bird flock and in this
<br>`(03:40)` bird slot
<br>`(03:42)` birds fly in a certain direction and
<br>`(03:45)` as they don't fly in random direction
<br>`(03:48)` but in somehow aligned directions you
<br>`(03:51)` can see these bird flocks
<br>`(03:53)` in the sky that form these patterns and
<br>`(03:56)` structures
<br>`(03:57)` on the sky so here
<br>`(04:00)` you don't have a super bird sitting
<br>`(04:03)` somewhere and telling these birds where
<br>`(04:04)` to fly
<br>`(04:05)` now that wouldn't even if such a thing
<br>`(04:07)` existed it would probably not work
<br>`(04:09)` because the
<br>`(04:09)` bird here on the left-hand side wouldn't
<br>`(04:12)` have any chance to communicate with the
<br>`(04:14)` bird on the right hand side
<br>`(04:15)` uh while while they're flying
<br>`(04:19)` now so that wouldn't work anyway so here
<br>`(04:22)` these birds somehow form these
<br>`(04:25)` structures
<br>`(04:26)` by local interactions they have a
<br>`(04:29)` short-range
<br>`(04:30)` interaction they communicate on very
<br>`(04:32)` short scales
<br>`(04:34)` and this gives rise to order on much
<br>`(04:37)` larger scales on the scale of this
<br>`(04:40)` entire flock here
<br>`(04:42)` so we're now also interested in how such
<br>`(04:45)` order
<br>`(04:46)` can rise how long range or very large
<br>`(04:49)` scale
<br>`(04:50)` can arise from interactions that happen
<br>`(04:53)` on a very small scale
<br>`(04:56)` so here these birds interact on
<br>`(04:59)` distances of one meter or so
<br>`(05:01)` but the order has a scale of hundreds of
<br>`(05:04)` meters
<br>`(05:05)` now so how is this scale reached
<br>`(05:10)` and although we'll be talking about
<br>`(05:12)` non-equilibrium
<br>`(05:14)` systems in this lecture uh
<br>`(05:17)` it's very often uh good to uh
<br>`(05:20)` take a look at how order actually arises
<br>`(05:24)` in equilibrium systems and as you
<br>`(05:26)` probably know many
<br>`(05:28)` people from biophases
<br>`(05:31)` theoretical biophysics for example
<br>`(05:34)` epidemiology and so they have a
<br>`(05:36)` background
<br>`(05:36)` in statistical physics or condensed
<br>`(05:39)` metaphysics
<br>`(05:40)` and the reason why they're pretty good
<br>`(05:43)` in
<br>`(05:43)` understanding apparently completely
<br>`(05:46)` unrelated systems
<br>`(05:47)` to to physical systems
<br>`(05:51)` is that these physical systems that can
<br>`(05:53)` be determined equilibrium
<br>`(05:54)` actually give us some intuition about
<br>`(05:57)` how order
<br>`(05:58)` arises now so let's start with a very
<br>`(06:00)` simple

### slide 2

<br>`(06:01)` equilibrium example now so probably most
<br>`(06:05)` of you have heard of the ising model
<br>`(06:07)` it's a very simple model for uh um
<br>`(06:10)` for a ferromagnet and uh in this icing
<br>`(06:14)` model
<br>`(06:15)` you have a hamiltonian you know so
<br>`(06:18)` energy and in this energy you just say
<br>`(06:21)` okay the name space you have a sum
<br>`(06:24)` over all neighbors of spins pairs of
<br>`(06:28)` neighboring spins
<br>`(06:30)` you know and you minimize the energy
<br>`(06:33)` if these neighbors are aligned in the
<br>`(06:35)` same direction
<br>`(06:39)` so now the energy favors
<br>`(06:43)` alignment of the spin in the same
<br>`(06:44)` direction but if you write down the
<br>`(06:46)` repetition function
<br>`(06:48)` yeah then you will see there's not only
<br>`(06:49)` energy but they're also under other
<br>`(06:51)` stuff that's important for example the
<br>`(06:52)` temperature
<br>`(06:54)` yeah so how and under which conditions
<br>`(06:56)` do these spins here that want to align
<br>`(06:59)` in the same direction the isaac model
<br>`(07:02)` when are they actually capable
<br>`(07:04)` of aligning in the same direction yeah
<br>`(07:07)` and there's a very famous argument
<br>`(07:10)` that was brought forward by piyo and
<br>`(07:15)` and this argument uh goes roughly as
<br>`(07:18)` follows
<br>`(07:18)` also as follows i suppose you have a
<br>`(07:20)` completely ordered state
<br>`(07:22)` where all these spins go in the same
<br>`(07:25)` direction
<br>`(07:26)` let's say they all point up now if i
<br>`(07:29)` flip
<br>`(07:30)` some of these prints is that favorable
<br>`(07:34)` or non-favorable and at equilibrium
<br>`(07:37)` systems
<br>`(07:38)` favorable means that we lower the free
<br>`(07:42)` energy
<br>`(07:44)` yeah so in this isaac model let's look
<br>`(07:46)` at one
<br>`(07:47)` dimension we can
<br>`(07:50)` flip a few spins like a little block of
<br>`(07:53)` size l
<br>`(07:55)` and calculate what is the change in free
<br>`(07:58)` energy
<br>`(07:59)` now this change in free energy
<br>`(08:02)` delta f is given by a component
<br>`(08:07)` that arises from the change in energy
<br>`(08:12)` and a component
<br>`(08:15)` that rises from a change in entropy
<br>`(08:19)` now that's just thermodynamics
<br>`(08:22)` this change in energy somehow encodes
<br>`(08:26)` these
<br>`(08:27)` interactions
<br>`(08:31)` now this change in entropy has the
<br>`(08:34)` temperature as a pre-factor
<br>`(08:36)` and this gives us the contribution of
<br>`(08:40)` the noise
<br>`(08:43)` now already by this formula you can see
<br>`(08:45)` that there's a competition
<br>`(08:47)` between these two uh forces
<br>`(08:50)` those are the interactions that try to
<br>`(08:52)` minimize the entropy
<br>`(08:54)` and the fluctuations that try to
<br>`(08:57)` maximize the second term
<br>`(09:00)` so we can just write that down yeah so
<br>`(09:03)` if you look at such a domain here
<br>`(09:05)` then we'll see that in one dimension we
<br>`(09:07)` have two boundaries
<br>`(09:09)` if each gives two times
<br>`(09:13)` this factor here yeah
<br>`(09:16)` and uh so that's four times j
<br>`(09:20)` minus kbt
<br>`(09:23)` and then that's the boltzmann entropy
<br>`(09:26)` how
<br>`(09:27)` many times can we fit
<br>`(09:30)` such a block into a system of size
<br>`(09:35)` yeah and then that's just the boltzmann
<br>`(09:38)` entropy
<br>`(09:38)` they also went uh you could just count
<br>`(09:42)` just count this block would fit
<br>`(09:45)` exactly
<br>`(09:49)` and minus l times
<br>`(09:53)` you know so we have these two
<br>`(09:55)` contributions
<br>`(09:57)` and now we go to the terminology limit
<br>`(10:00)` yeah that means we set n the system size
<br>`(10:04)` to infinity and then this thermodynamic
<br>`(10:07)` limit the second term will always be
<br>`(10:10)` larger
<br>`(10:10)` than the first term now the entropy
<br>`(10:12)` contribution
<br>`(10:13)` will always be larger than the energy
<br>`(10:16)` contribution
<br>`(10:18)` yeah and this means that this is always
<br>`(10:21)` smaller than zero
<br>`(10:24)` yeah and this is probably a result that
<br>`(10:26)` you already know that there is no
<br>`(10:30)` long-range order in
<br>`(10:34)` the 1d ising module
<br>`(10:37)` for finite temperatures
<br>`(10:45)` yeah so only at temperature exactly
<br>`(10:48)` equals zero
<br>`(10:49)` you can have alignment of these spins
<br>`(10:54)` so what it says here is so
<br>`(10:57)` these pins still want to align yeah and
<br>`(11:00)` you can ask
<br>`(11:02)` this alignment information about these
<br>`(11:04)` spins
<br>`(11:05)` how far can this travel through the
<br>`(11:07)` system
<br>`(11:09)` until the temperature destroys the
<br>`(11:11)` information
<br>`(11:13)` this tells you it will net it tells you
<br>`(11:14)` it will never make it
<br>`(11:16)` through the entire system you know and
<br>`(11:18)` it will you will never be able
<br>`(11:20)` to transport the uh the alignment
<br>`(11:23)` information
<br>`(11:24)` spins from one end of the system to the
<br>`(11:27)` other end of the system
<br>`(11:30)` now this is for one spatial dimension
<br>`(11:33)` and in one spatial dimension
<br>`(11:35)` every spin only has two neighbors so if
<br>`(11:38)` one neighbor changes something that will
<br>`(11:39)` always have
<br>`(11:40)` a strong effect that will always these
<br>`(11:43)` spins are always subject to
<br>`(11:45)` a lot of modes the more neighbors you
<br>`(11:48)` have
<br>`(11:49)` you know the less important are these
<br>`(11:52)` fluctuations if you have for example
<br>`(11:56)` in the 2d ising system you have four
<br>`(11:59)` neighbors
<br>`(12:00)` or eight neighbors depending how you
<br>`(12:01)` define it
<br>`(12:03)` you know that you already from your
<br>`(12:05)` statistical physics sector
<br>`(12:07)` you know that you can get order you get
<br>`(12:09)` a phase transition
<br>`(12:10)` from a disordered state to an ordered
<br>`(12:13)` state
<br>`(12:14)` that is you can see here at the top
<br>`(12:16)` that's the ordered state where all spins
<br>`(12:18)` are aligned in the same way
<br>`(12:20)` and if you raise the temperature that
<br>`(12:22)` would be a critical point
<br>`(12:24)` where uh so let's say these both terms
<br>`(12:27)` from the free energy
<br>`(12:28)` and roughly equal strength and if you
<br>`(12:31)` further
<br>`(12:32)` further raise the temperature you will
<br>`(12:34)` see that
<br>`(12:35)` this the system is completely disordered
<br>`(12:40)` yeah take-home message here is and of
<br>`(12:42)` course if you go to higher
<br>`(12:43)` uh systems now then it's easier then
<br>`(12:46)` this
<br>`(12:46)` same result space transitions will be
<br>`(12:48)` reinforced
<br>`(12:49)` i will become as
<br>`(12:52)` spins are able to average over more and
<br>`(12:56)` more neighbors
<br>`(12:57)` now so the take-home message here is
<br>`(13:00)` that we have this competition
<br>`(13:02)` between the transport of interaction
<br>`(13:05)` information
<br>`(13:06)` through the system add the noise
<br>`(13:09)` yeah and the balance between these two
<br>`(13:12)` uh will decide if you can have
<br>`(13:13)` long-range order
<br>`(13:15)` in such a system and although this
<br>`(13:18)` is a example for an acrylic from
<br>`(13:21)` equilibrium
<br>`(13:23)` yeah so this is actually a very powerful
<br>`(13:25)` thing to keep in the back of your head
<br>`(13:27)` now that you can get older if the
<br>`(13:30)` interactions that say
<br>`(13:31)` are stronger than several resources
<br>`(13:34)` that lead to perturbations or that lead
<br>`(13:37)` to noise
<br>`(13:40)` yeah so here we had a very simple time
<br>`(13:43)` because we have the free energy
<br>`(13:44)` we know where the system is evolving to
<br>`(13:48)` in non-equilibrium systems
<br>`(13:51)` we don't have this free energy we don't
<br>`(13:54)` know what is being optimized
<br>`(13:56)` and for the rest of the lecture
<br>`(14:00)` i will show you how we can
<br>`(14:03)` transport this argument by
<br>`(14:06)` pilots to non-equilibrium systems

### slide 3

<br>`(14:16)` so in the first step
<br>`(14:20)` i want to take
<br>`(14:23)` i want to stay in equilibrium but i want
<br>`(14:25)` to take a dynamic
<br>`(14:26)` perspective and this dynamic
<br>`(14:30)` perspective uh is encoded
<br>`(14:33)` uh so we'll take a dynamic perspective
<br>`(14:35)` on an equilibrium
<br>`(14:36)` system and this equilibrium system
<br>`(14:41)` is defined on the right hand side yeah
<br>`(14:44)` and
<br>`(14:44)` there's an anecdote actually by one of
<br>`(14:47)` the people in the field
<br>`(14:48)` john toner and the anecdote
<br>`(14:52)` he used to describe this system is that
<br>`(14:55)` suppose you are in
<br>`(14:56)` a conference yeah or you are in the
<br>`(14:58)` entrance hall after work
<br>`(15:00)` in your instant institute and you are
<br>`(15:03)` around with a couple of people
<br>`(15:05)` and now you stand next to each other and
<br>`(15:06)` you decide where to go for dinner
<br>`(15:09)` and now you all have different
<br>`(15:12)` opinions and what you decide what to do
<br>`(15:15)` how you decide what to do
<br>`(15:16)` is you all point in a random direction
<br>`(15:20)` and then you change the direction you're
<br>`(15:22)` pointing at
<br>`(15:24)` depending on what your neighbors are
<br>`(15:26)` doing
<br>`(15:27)` now you stay where you are but you point
<br>`(15:30)` to the directions that your neighbor
<br>`(15:33)` your neighbors are pointing at
<br>`(15:35)` yeah and this is depicted here we have
<br>`(15:38)` these points here that's you
<br>`(15:40)` deciding uh where to go for dinner and
<br>`(15:44)` uh so here we have that point in the
<br>`(15:46)` center
<br>`(15:47)` and this point in the center has an
<br>`(15:49)` interaction radius yeah and within this
<br>`(15:51)` radius
<br>`(15:52)` are not this point looks around
<br>`(15:56)` and averages its new direction
<br>`(15:59)` over whatever it finds in this vicinity
<br>`(16:03)` in this neighborhood here
<br>`(16:04)` now so that's a formalized in this way
<br>`(16:07)` this is
<br>`(16:08)` so you update your new direction
<br>`(16:13)` by taking the average over all neighbors
<br>`(16:19)` over all neighbors but you also make a
<br>`(16:22)` mistake
<br>`(16:23)` now you can have some random and some
<br>`(16:25)` fluctuating force
<br>`(16:28)` that actually changes the direction
<br>`(16:31)` you're pointing at now so you're
<br>`(16:32)` basically doing like this yeah
<br>`(16:36)` and uh this force is as neutral yeah
<br>`(16:39)` this is
<br>`(16:39)` caution it's uncorrelated and it has
<br>`(16:42)` that it's uncorrelated in space and time
<br>`(16:45)` and it has a strength delta which we
<br>`(16:47)` know because when equilibrium has
<br>`(16:49)` something to do
<br>`(16:51)` with the temperature you know
<br>`(16:52)` fluctuation dissipation
<br>`(16:56)` so that's the system and now the
<br>`(17:00)` question is
<br>`(17:01)` can we come
<br>`(17:04)` to consensus on where to go
<br>`(17:08)` to dinner yeah so this system here
<br>`(17:12)` has a rotational symmetry yeah in this
<br>`(17:16)` model there's nothing
<br>`(17:17)` that tells you so we should go east or
<br>`(17:20)` west or north or south
<br>`(17:22)` yeah in the first place what we're now
<br>`(17:26)` asking is can this rotational symmetry
<br>`(17:28)` be broken
<br>`(17:30)` now can we align these arrows
<br>`(17:33)` all in the same direction when one
<br>`(17:35)` direction becomes special
<br>`(17:37)` or will we always have a a case where
<br>`(17:40)` when we average over all directions
<br>`(17:42)` now we don't get a clear answer where to
<br>`(17:45)` go
<br>`(17:47)` now and the answer to this now think
<br>`(17:49)` about the
<br>`(17:50)` last slide will depend
<br>`(17:54)` on the strength of the noise yeah
<br>`(17:57)` or the temperature you know we for
<br>`(18:01)` uh this delta
<br>`(18:04)` equals zero we can expect well there's
<br>`(18:07)` no other thing that's only interaction
<br>`(18:08)` and nothing else that stops you from
<br>`(18:10)` aligning
<br>`(18:11)` you know these pointers
<br>`(18:17)` align
<br>`(18:21)` in same
<br>`(18:24)` direction now so that's something we can
<br>`(18:26)` expect
<br>`(18:28)` so what happens if we turn on the noise
<br>`(18:35)` what if we turn on the noise
<br>`(18:39)` so first this noise is caution
<br>`(18:47)` yeah so this noise is caution
<br>`(18:51)` and this lecture will be full of hand
<br>`(18:52)` waving arguments that's why i'm getting
<br>`(18:54)` away with school mathematics
<br>`(18:56)` yeah so this lecture is expansion yeah
<br>`(18:58)` and
<br>`(18:59)` if we look in a certain time interval
<br>`(19:03)` and see how this
<br>`(19:07)` angle will change of a certain particle
<br>`(19:11)` now then this follows a diffusion
<br>`(19:13)` equation
<br>`(19:15)` delta t tata is something like
<br>`(19:20)` diffusion equation uh nabla squared
<br>`(19:26)` tata why did we get the diffusion
<br>`(19:28)` equation it's just like the random walks
<br>`(19:30)` like the brownian motion
<br>`(19:32)` yeah you there's nothing here in this
<br>`(19:33)` model that is non
<br>`(19:35)` uh that is out of equilibrium you're
<br>`(19:38)` being pushed
<br>`(19:38)` right in random directions yeah and you
<br>`(19:42)` try to align with your neighbors
<br>`(19:44)` and this just gives you a diffusion
<br>`(19:46)` equation or heat equation
<br>`(19:48)` yeah so we have this heat equation
<br>`(19:52)` and this heat equation means that we
<br>`(19:54)` transport information
<br>`(19:56)` about our angle diffusively through the
<br>`(19:59)` system
<br>`(20:00)` you know basically with a random like a
<br>`(20:02)` random walk
<br>`(20:04)` yeah so remember the first lecture
<br>`(20:08)` so we transport information diffusively
<br>`(20:10)` and this means we transport information
<br>`(20:12)` very slowly it's a very efficient way of
<br>`(20:15)` transporting information
<br>`(20:18)` and now we come up with a first
<br>`(20:21)` line of arguments uh that is
<br>`(20:25)` very powerful in statistical physics i
<br>`(20:26)` don't know if you
<br>`(20:28)` do that in statistical first physical
<br>`(20:30)` physics lecture
<br>`(20:32)` yeah but it's very intuitive what is
<br>`(20:35)` what is so and this is called a scaling
<br>`(20:37)` argument
<br>`(20:38)` so what we're interested in for the rest
<br>`(20:40)` of this lecture is not
<br>`(20:42)` exact solutions of of equations yeah and
<br>`(20:45)` we are not interested in
<br>`(20:47)` pre-factors or in numbers we're just
<br>`(20:50)` interested in exponents
<br>`(20:52)` now we're interested in how things
<br>`(20:54)` change
<br>`(20:55)` when we go to infinity and for example
<br>`(20:58)` times goes to infinity how fast do we
<br>`(21:00)` give infinity
<br>`(21:01)` and this is described by exponents
<br>`(21:05)` yeah at this diffusion equation also has
<br>`(21:07)` exponents
<br>`(21:09)` yeah so we remember the first lecture
<br>`(21:11)` brownian motion
<br>`(21:13)` you know then we know that the typical
<br>`(21:15)` distance
<br>`(21:17)` let's call it r
<br>`(21:20)` that this information travels if it's
<br>`(21:23)` governed by
<br>`(21:24)` the diffusion equation scales like
<br>`(21:29)` the square root of time
<br>`(21:33)` yeah this is uh the first uh
<br>`(21:37)` scaling argument in this lecture yeah so
<br>`(21:40)` so another way to see that
<br>`(21:42)` i know it's a little bit it's not it
<br>`(21:43)` always sounds fishy if you did it for
<br>`(21:45)` the first time but it's a very powerful
<br>`(21:47)` argument because you don't have to do
<br>`(21:48)` any calculations
<br>`(21:50)` on the left hand side here we have
<br>`(21:53)` something like
<br>`(21:54)` one over time
<br>`(21:57)` yeah the first derivative with time
<br>`(21:59)` something like 1 over time
<br>`(22:01)` and this here on the right hand side is
<br>`(22:03)` something like 1
<br>`(22:04)` over distance squared
<br>`(22:08)` yeah the left is time right is distance
<br>`(22:11)` squared and this is how you can get this
<br>`(22:13)` relationship
<br>`(22:14)` r scales like square root
<br>`(22:17)` of time well of course this is also
<br>`(22:20)` a basic property of
<br>`(22:24)` any diffusing process now that the mean
<br>`(22:26)` square the
<br>`(22:27)` standard deviation increases with the
<br>`(22:29)` square root of time
<br>`(22:32)` so this is the first step and
<br>`(22:35)` uh now what is r and t
<br>`(22:38)` now so i didn't tell you what r and t
<br>`(22:41)` are r and t
<br>`(22:42)` are some time and length scales
<br>`(22:46)` now for example this r
<br>`(22:50)` is the distance
<br>`(22:53)` or proportional to the distance or
<br>`(22:55)` scales with the distance
<br>`(22:58)` over which
<br>`(23:03)` the perturbation
<br>`(23:08)` delta theta
<br>`(23:13)` uh spreads
<br>`(23:17)` it's a typical length scale of then we
<br>`(23:18)` can't give it a number also but we're
<br>`(23:20)` not interested in the number
<br>`(23:22)` it's just the distance and one example
<br>`(23:24)` of such a typical distance
<br>`(23:26)` is the length scale over which a
<br>`(23:28)` perturbation spreads
<br>`(23:32)` yeah we can also say if you have a
<br>`(23:35)` conventional system
<br>`(23:36)` that's at the volume so we have a volume
<br>`(23:40)` and if the length stays with the square
<br>`(23:43)` root of t
<br>`(23:45)` then the volume scales with
<br>`(23:48)` time to the power of d over two
<br>`(23:54)` yeah so nothing really is happening here
<br>`(23:57)` you just have to digest
<br>`(23:59)` that you can do these things and you can
<br>`(24:02)` learn something yeah
<br>`(24:04)` so that's that's the only tricky thing
<br>`(24:06)` with these scaling arguments
<br>`(24:07)` at first they sound fishy yeah but
<br>`(24:11)` if you see the end results they make
<br>`(24:13)` sense and the reason
<br>`(24:14)` is that we're not asking quantitative
<br>`(24:17)` questions we're asking questions of
<br>`(24:20)` scaling behavior
<br>`(24:21)` how do things scale with in relation to
<br>`(24:25)` each other
<br>`(24:25)` how do they change in relation to each
<br>`(24:27)` other and here this means
<br>`(24:30)` length scales and
<br>`(24:33)` time scales scale in this way
<br>`(24:37)` because they are defined by a diffusion
<br>`(24:39)` equation
<br>`(24:40)` that's how to read these things

### slide 4

<br>`(24:45)` and now we go on with school mathematics
<br>`(24:49)` now let's go on with school mathematics
<br>`(24:51)` yeah
<br>`(24:56)` now we just plug things into each other
<br>`(24:59)` so
<br>`(25:00)` we can calculate different things the
<br>`(25:02)` first the error
<br>`(25:05)` on color
<br>`(25:12)` error
<br>`(25:16)` per pointer
<br>`(25:20)` yeah and that's what we call
<br>`(25:23)` delta teta and this scales like now we
<br>`(25:28)` leave away any prefectures or anything
<br>`(25:31)` delta theta i over
<br>`(25:35)` the volume
<br>`(25:40)` now we have to divide by volume yeah and
<br>`(25:42)` then
<br>`(25:43)` this goes with t to the minus
<br>`(25:47)` t over two
<br>`(25:52)` and now we can ask how many errors or
<br>`(25:54)` how many of these
<br>`(25:56)` fluctuations in the wrong direction do
<br>`(25:57)` we have her volume
<br>`(26:00)` yeah number
<br>`(26:04)` of perturbations
<br>`(26:10)` in volume
<br>`(26:15)` v we call that n
<br>`(26:20)` and this scales like the time
<br>`(26:25)` to the power of the volume now the
<br>`(26:28)` volume tells you how many
<br>`(26:30)` particles do i have how many pointers do
<br>`(26:32)` i have
<br>`(26:33)` at the time tells you how long you're
<br>`(26:35)` looking
<br>`(26:37)` yeah it's a very trivial relationship
<br>`(26:40)` yeah and then we just plug this in
<br>`(26:43)` and we get t to the d over two
<br>`(26:54)` now what is now the typical
<br>`(26:59)` scale of a fluctuation
<br>`(27:03)` now we have central limit theory we have
<br>`(27:05)` many
<br>`(27:06)` fluctuations summing
<br>`(27:13)` over
<br>`(27:16)` many fluctuations
<br>`(27:23)` we find that we have a typical size
<br>`(27:29)` now of these fluctuations
<br>`(27:32)` that goes with the square root of n
<br>`(27:35)` now that's just the same central limits
<br>`(27:37)` theorem now there will be some
<br>`(27:39)` prefectures will be all kind of
<br>`(27:40)` complicated things but we know
<br>`(27:42)` it will because of the central limits
<br>`(27:43)` the theorem stay with the square root of
<br>`(27:46)` n and this
<br>`(27:48)` scales with again leaving away any
<br>`(27:52)` pre-factor
<br>`(27:53)` t times time times volume
<br>`(27:58)` no this is the central limit theorem
<br>`(28:04)` and now we can
<br>`(28:08)` look at a certain region in space
<br>`(28:13)` and ask how is the single pointer
<br>`(28:16)` affected
<br>`(28:18)` by this fluctuation by this omega
<br>`(28:21)` now density
<br>`(28:37)` a pointer now the density
<br>`(28:42)` and then we take this capsule omega
<br>`(28:46)` and divide it by the volume
<br>`(28:50)` yeah and this looks
<br>`(28:53)` goes like time over
<br>`(28:57)` if you just plug us in time of volume
<br>`(29:00)` again just plugging in r to the power of
<br>`(29:04)` minus one minus d over
<br>`(29:07)` two

### slide 5

<br>`(29:11)` know what does it
<br>`(29:14)` mean now for large distances
<br>`(29:18)` yeah how does our so we have look
<br>`(29:21)` so we have a homogeneous system
<br>`(29:26)` we you know all are looking suppose
<br>`(29:29)` we're all looking in the same direction
<br>`(29:32)` yeah think about the icing model in the
<br>`(29:34)` first slide
<br>`(29:35)` all spins are pointing in the same
<br>`(29:37)` direction all people
<br>`(29:39)` are looking pointing in the same
<br>`(29:40)` direction yeah now
<br>`(29:42)` somebody turns around and shows
<br>`(29:45)` somewhere else
<br>`(29:47)` yeah so that's an error or that's a
<br>`(29:49)` that's one of these perturbations that
<br>`(29:51)` we had on the first slide
<br>`(29:52)` you know where we introduced these wrong
<br>`(29:54)` spins and see
<br>`(29:56)` and saw whether they changed the free
<br>`(29:58)` energy
<br>`(29:59)` now here we do the same thing we turn
<br>`(30:01)` somebody around
<br>`(30:03)` and ask whether this turning around of
<br>`(30:06)` this person
<br>`(30:07)` will destabilize the entire system
<br>`(30:11)` and it will destabilize the entire
<br>`(30:13)` system if this information
<br>`(30:15)` of somebody turning around propagates
<br>`(30:18)` through the entire system
<br>`(30:24)` and now we can see also we are
<br>`(30:26)` interested
<br>`(30:28)` in this r to infinity
<br>`(30:32)` so this goes to zero
<br>`(30:37)` for d larger than two
<br>`(30:41)` now this propagation this this uh this
<br>`(30:44)` um this error this fluctuation
<br>`(30:47)` decays with the with the distance
<br>`(30:50)` yeah it will at some point it will
<br>`(30:52)` vanish so in d larger than two
<br>`(30:54)` we can't have the order now we can
<br>`(30:57)` arrange in the same direction
<br>`(31:00)` this goes to infinity
<br>`(31:03)` for d smaller than two
<br>`(31:08)` you know for d smaller than two
<br>`(31:11)` uh this goes to infinity and we cannot
<br>`(31:13)` have any order
<br>`(31:15)` now because somebody turns around and it
<br>`(31:18)` destabilizes the entire system
<br>`(31:20)` you know so this error here
<br>`(31:24)` will increase and become infinity
<br>`(31:27)` will go into the entire system and then
<br>`(31:30)` for d
<br>`(31:32)` equals two we actually have to do some
<br>`(31:34)` mathematics
<br>`(31:36)` then we see that this depends on the
<br>`(31:39)` system size
<br>`(31:41)` but this also then goes to infinity
<br>`(31:48)` so what does this mean what have you
<br>`(31:49)` learned so this was an equilibrium
<br>`(31:51)` system
<br>`(31:52)` there was nothing that was out of
<br>`(31:53)` equilibrium and actually this system is
<br>`(31:55)` more or less equivalent
<br>`(31:56)` to the xy model you know so we have
<br>`(31:59)` spins at the plane
<br>`(32:01)` you know and they turn at an angle and
<br>`(32:03)` you see whether you have enough
<br>`(32:04)` the xy model in statistical physics
<br>`(32:07)` and we've seen that for
<br>`(32:10)` d larger than the following dimension
<br>`(32:13)` larger than two
<br>`(32:15)` we can have long range order
<br>`(32:18)` because these fluctuations all these
<br>`(32:20)` errors are introduced
<br>`(32:23)` they decay or they become small
<br>`(32:27)` for d equals two or smaller
<br>`(32:31)` these fluctuations or these
<br>`(32:33)` perturbations are perturbed somewhere i
<br>`(32:35)` have a little
<br>`(32:36)` noise that this will immediately spread
<br>`(32:39)` and destabilize our order
<br>`(32:43)` any long-range order is destroyed four
<br>`(32:46)` dimensions
<br>`(32:46)` equal or smaller than two and that's
<br>`(32:49)` actually here
<br>`(32:50)` a manifestation of the mermain
<br>`(32:53)` wagner theorem from equilibrium
<br>`(32:55)` statistical physics
<br>`(32:56)` which tells you that you have a system
<br>`(32:59)` described by some hamiltonian
<br>`(33:01)` and you have a continuous symmetry
<br>`(33:05)` now that means that continuous symmetry
<br>`(33:08)` means that unlike in the izing model
<br>`(33:12)` where you can decide between plus one or
<br>`(33:14)` minus one
<br>`(33:16)` in a continuous symmetry you can change
<br>`(33:18)` your state
<br>`(33:19)` continuously right and can take a real
<br>`(33:22)` value
<br>`(33:23)` like in this case here an angle
<br>`(33:26)` yeah so if you have a system and
<br>`(33:29)` two or less dimensions that is in
<br>`(33:31)` equilibrium and that has some
<br>`(33:33)` short range interactions then uh
<br>`(33:38)` the symmetries cannot be broken so that
<br>`(33:41)` means that there cannot be
<br>`(33:42)` any order and the reason for this is if
<br>`(33:45)` you remember a statistical physics
<br>`(33:47)` lecture is that
<br>`(33:49)` with very minimal energy cost you can
<br>`(33:53)` twist
<br>`(33:53)` these directions very slightly and very
<br>`(33:56)` slowly
<br>`(33:57)` through the entire system yeah and
<br>`(34:00)` by this you can break you can destroy
<br>`(34:03)` any order
<br>`(34:04)` with very minimal energy deconsumption
<br>`(34:07)` if neighboring spins
<br>`(34:09)` just or if neighboring pointers just
<br>`(34:11)` differ by a small
<br>`(34:12)` amount yeah and this is called a
<br>`(34:15)` goldstone mode
<br>`(34:17)` now that destroys the order in these
<br>`(34:20)` systems
<br>`(34:21)` well of course in these systems many
<br>`(34:22)` other things can happen you think about
<br>`(34:24)` custom and stylus you can have
<br>`(34:26)` topological order you cannot have an
<br>`(34:28)` average spin
<br>`(34:29)` but you can have structures of vortices
<br>`(34:33)` and quantity systems
<br>`(34:34)` happening but here in equilibrium
<br>`(34:38)` again the message if we ask how
<br>`(34:41)` fluctuation how an error progresses
<br>`(34:45)` throughout the system now is it
<br>`(34:48)` does it decay now is it repressed or
<br>`(34:52)` does it grow
<br>`(34:54)` that tells us something about whether or
<br>`(34:56)` not
<br>`(34:57)` long-range order can exist yeah whether
<br>`(35:00)` all of these pointers can point in the
<br>`(35:03)` same direction
<br>`(35:05)` yeah this is formalized in the mermaid
<br>`(35:07)` partner theory
<br>`(35:10)` just to emphasize that this is the same
<br>`(35:12)` idea that we had in the first slide
<br>`(35:15)` here in the piles argument in the ising
<br>`(35:19)` system
<br>`(35:20)` we introduced a perturbation here
<br>`(35:25)` and then we didn't look at this
<br>`(35:26)` dynamically but statically
<br>`(35:29)` also we asked is this perturbation
<br>`(35:31)` actually favorable
<br>`(35:33)` or not if it's favorable you have these
<br>`(35:35)` motivations all the time and this
<br>`(35:36)` motivation will actually survive
<br>`(35:38)` in the long term it was the same
<br>`(35:41)` reasoning
<br>`(35:42)` but because we are here in equilibrium
<br>`(35:44)` we can have
<br>`(35:45)` a very elegant formulation of the free
<br>`(35:47)` energy
<br>`(35:49)` and now with these pointers
<br>`(35:52)` so we could have of course made a
<br>`(35:54)` similar easy argument
<br>`(35:56)` but we went to the dynamic direction to
<br>`(35:58)` see how things spread over time and in
<br>`(36:00)` space
<br>`(36:01)` uh because of course this is this this
<br>`(36:03)` is where we'll be heading
<br>`(36:05)` now in the next step when we go to out
<br>`(36:07)` of equilibrium

### slide 6

<br>`(36:14)` okay so how can we go out of equilibrium
<br>`(36:18)` now how can we not be in equilibrium
<br>`(36:20)` here
<br>`(36:21)` the way we can do that is by making
<br>`(36:25)` the particles move yeah so and remember
<br>`(36:28)` we had that in the very first lecture as
<br>`(36:31)` well with these active brownian
<br>`(36:32)` particles
<br>`(36:34)` with this bacterium and this bacterium
<br>`(36:36)` was
<br>`(36:37)` consuming energy and it was turning this
<br>`(36:40)` energy
<br>`(36:41)` into kinetic energy taking up chemical
<br>`(36:45)` energy
<br>`(36:45)` and was uh and turn it into the kinetic
<br>`(36:49)` energy
<br>`(36:50)` and using this kinetic energy it was
<br>`(36:52)` would
<br>`(36:54)` or would just that propel flipped
<br>`(36:56)` flagella
<br>`(36:58)` you know that they were pointing out of
<br>`(36:59)` this bacteria and that would make the
<br>`(37:01)` material move
<br>`(37:02)` ballistically through the system
<br>`(37:05)` yeah and but that was a single bacterium
<br>`(37:09)` here we're now looking at how these
<br>`(37:12)` bacteria
<br>`(37:13)` behave to say if you put many of them
<br>`(37:16)` into the same system
<br>`(37:18)` and one of the first people uh
<br>`(37:22)` who was looking at these kind of systems
<br>`(37:25)` was called thomas mischeck and
<br>`(37:28)` he defined a model
<br>`(37:31)` with very few ingredients actually yeah
<br>`(37:34)` so the first ingredient is that your
<br>`(37:36)` self-repulsion now that you have
<br>`(37:38)` this bacteria and this bacteria
<br>`(37:41)` they move if nothing happens they move
<br>`(37:43)` ballistically
<br>`(37:44)` and at the same direction and this
<br>`(37:47)` already tells us
<br>`(37:51)` this already tells us that the system is
<br>`(37:56)` out of equilibrium
<br>`(38:01)` because you necessarily break the
<br>`(38:03)` fluctuation dissipation
<br>`(38:07)` then these particles interact and they
<br>`(38:10)` interact
<br>`(38:11)` by following their neighbors
<br>`(38:15)` and that's exactly the same thing as the
<br>`(38:17)` pointers in the previous case
<br>`(38:19)` and these interactions are as previously
<br>`(38:22)` short range
<br>`(38:27)` now which means that they
<br>`(38:31)` have a limited distance
<br>`(38:34)` over which they're interacting and
<br>`(38:36)` typically called are not
<br>`(38:38)` you see but also in this picture on the
<br>`(38:39)` top right here
<br>`(38:41)` now so you have a circumference around
<br>`(38:43)` the particle
<br>`(38:45)` and what you then do is you average your
<br>`(38:48)` direction
<br>`(38:49)` over all particles that are in your
<br>`(38:51)` neighborhoods
<br>`(38:55)` so now
<br>`(39:00)` we also have errors now so we're not
<br>`(39:02)` taking exactly the average direction
<br>`(39:04)` but the average direction plus some
<br>`(39:07)` error that we make
<br>`(39:08)` plus plus some fluctuation plus some
<br>`(39:10)` fluctuating force
<br>`(39:12)` that we can't predict yeah so then we
<br>`(39:14)` have noise
<br>`(39:20)` and that means as before that
<br>`(39:23)` you can formalize this that as the next
<br>`(39:25)` time step
<br>`(39:27)` you take the direction that is the
<br>`(39:29)` average
<br>`(39:31)` overall your neighbors
<br>`(39:35)` now and then you have some noise
<br>`(39:39)` atta of t
<br>`(39:46)` so and then last you again also have
<br>`(39:50)` rotational symmetry
<br>`(39:51)` and this rotational symmetry again means
<br>`(39:53)` yeah that you there's no
<br>`(39:55)` a priori direction in which
<br>`(39:58)` uh these particles move yeah so if
<br>`(40:01)` nothing happens if you didn't have any
<br>`(40:03)` interactions
<br>`(40:04)` or if you were on the microscopic level
<br>`(40:07)` if you pick a random particle
<br>`(40:09)` then you would expect it to move also in
<br>`(40:11)` a random direction
<br>`(40:12)` yeah and now we ask again
<br>`(40:15)` can this rotational symmetry
<br>`(40:19)` be broken yeah so if you write down we
<br>`(40:22)` have some equations
<br>`(40:23)` there's nothing that points out with a
<br>`(40:25)` certain direction now there's not no
<br>`(40:28)` north or east in the equations or in the
<br>`(40:30)` simulation
<br>`(40:32)` but can we have a preferred direction
<br>`(40:34)` nevertheless
<br>`(40:37)` on the macroscopic scale the average of
<br>`(40:39)` all particles

### slide 7

<br>`(40:42)` so this looks like very much
<br>`(40:45)` like uh the system we had on the
<br>`(40:49)` previous slides the equilibrium system
<br>`(40:51)` the only difference
<br>`(40:53)` is that these particles are moving so
<br>`(40:56)` what does it
<br>`(40:56)` actually mean that they are moving what
<br>`(40:58)` is actually the essence of that
<br>`(41:01)` now so if it were all moving together
<br>`(41:03)` with each other you could just go
<br>`(41:05)` into a reference frame and then you
<br>`(41:06)` would be back in the original
<br>`(41:09)` system in the equilibrium system
<br>`(41:12)` but what is happening here is not only
<br>`(41:14)` that they're moving but because they're
<br>`(41:16)` moving
<br>`(41:17)` they're changing their neighbors all the
<br>`(41:20)` time
<br>`(41:22)` you know so you remember in the previous
<br>`(41:24)` case
<br>`(41:25)` we had uh you have your neighbors yeah
<br>`(41:28)` and then you do something you align
<br>`(41:30)` and then this alignment information or
<br>`(41:32)` your angle information
<br>`(41:34)` is transported diffusively
<br>`(41:38)` to your name over your neighbors
<br>`(41:41)` through the system now your neighbors
<br>`(41:44)` change
<br>`(41:47)` and because your neighbors change all
<br>`(41:48)` the time also the information in which
<br>`(41:51)` direction you're going
<br>`(41:53)` is propagated in different ways
<br>`(41:56)` and that's actually all the magic
<br>`(41:59)` now as a first step let me just show you
<br>`(42:03)` that you can actually describe the
<br>`(42:05)` system
<br>`(42:06)` in the kind of equations that we were
<br>`(42:09)` looking at in the previous slides
<br>`(42:11)` in the previous lectures so this is the
<br>`(42:14)` stochastic differential equation
<br>`(42:16)` that describes the dynamics
<br>`(42:20)` and the way so so we won't go in we
<br>`(42:23)` don't use it here
<br>`(42:25)` i just wanted to point out that first
<br>`(42:28)` such an equation is this
<br>`(42:30)` and also the way you can derive it
<br>`(42:34)` so what you do is basically you go
<br>`(42:38)` from particles to fields now that means
<br>`(42:41)` you zoom out
<br>`(42:43)` you're only interested in resolving slow
<br>`(42:46)` changes in the densities and direction
<br>`(42:49)` and that's always
<br>`(42:50)` the assumption that you make if you're
<br>`(42:51)` going through a field
<br>`(42:53)` and in this if you do that
<br>`(42:57)` then you just write down all possible
<br>`(43:00)` terms
<br>`(43:01)` that are in agreement with the basic
<br>`(43:04)` symmetries
<br>`(43:05)` of the microscopic rules that describe
<br>`(43:10)` the dynamics of the previous slides
<br>`(43:13)` then you get tons of different terms
<br>`(43:15)` yeah that are in agreement
<br>`(43:17)` and what you then do is that you reason
<br>`(43:20)` which terms are
<br>`(43:21)` actually important and you can do then
<br>`(43:25)` arguments from
<br>`(43:26)` renamorization group theory for example
<br>`(43:28)` is the term
<br>`(43:29)` actually important to understand these
<br>`(43:31)` exponents or not
<br>`(43:33)` you can make other arguments and
<br>`(43:36)` this is how you derive these equations
<br>`(43:39)` another way to derive these equations by
<br>`(43:41)` starting from a microscopic theory
<br>`(43:43)` you know by really with some hamiltonian
<br>`(43:45)` or so
<br>`(43:46)` osman equations and then derive
<br>`(43:50)` in a very lengthy calculation derive
<br>`(43:53)` these
<br>`(43:54)` equations that you see here now so this
<br>`(43:56)` equation that you see here has a time
<br>`(43:58)` derivative of the velocity
<br>`(44:01)` then here is a convection term
<br>`(44:05)` now things that flow in some direction
<br>`(44:07)` of the flow here
<br>`(44:09)` uh and then here you have a potential
<br>`(44:12)` for the velocity that looks like this is
<br>`(44:15)` the typical
<br>`(44:17)` the typical potential that you assume
<br>`(44:19)` here there's no
<br>`(44:20)` underlying microscopic reason for this
<br>`(44:23)` necessarily
<br>`(44:25)` and this potential just says that the
<br>`(44:28)` average velocity
<br>`(44:29)` should go to some kind of minimum so
<br>`(44:32)` that these particles in the end
<br>`(44:34)` all have some similar average velocity
<br>`(44:37)` that's what newton's for you have a term
<br>`(44:39)` that depends on the pressure
<br>`(44:41)` now you want to punish particles all
<br>`(44:43)` being on the same position
<br>`(44:45)` and then you have your terms that
<br>`(44:49)` also come in that also have some
<br>`(44:52)` not so intuitive meanings but if you
<br>`(44:55)` are in um i have a background in
<br>`(44:58)` hydrodynamics for example
<br>`(45:00)` you see here a term that a prefected
<br>`(45:03)` aesthetic
<br>`(45:04)` describes about viscosity and this would
<br>`(45:07)` be a sheer viscosity
<br>`(45:08)` and this equation overall looks also
<br>`(45:11)` like the nadia stokes equation
<br>`(45:13)` now so it looks a little bit like the
<br>`(45:15)` navier-stokes equation
<br>`(45:17)` and then you have here the fluctuating
<br>`(45:19)` force
<br>`(45:20)` that is a gaussian and null and
<br>`(45:22)` uncorrelated
<br>`(45:24)` and you have an additional equation on
<br>`(45:26)` the bottom that describes that the
<br>`(45:28)` density
<br>`(45:30)` can only change if you take particles
<br>`(45:32)` from another cis
<br>`(45:33)` part of the system so that the mass of
<br>`(45:36)` the system is actually conserved
<br>`(45:37)` and these particles cannot disappear
<br>`(45:40)` into nowhere
<br>`(45:42)` i just want to tell you that you could
<br>`(45:43)` now take
<br>`(45:45)` uh the tools that we derived in the last
<br>`(45:48)` uh
<br>`(45:49)` in the last lectures and derive the
<br>`(45:51)` field theory from that
<br>`(45:52)` or to derive uh uh to do renormalization
<br>`(45:56)` of that something that we do in
<br>`(45:58)` december and then you'll get to very
<br>`(46:01)` similar results and i'll show you now
<br>`(46:02)` for the rest of the
<br>`(46:03)` lecture now we won't do that here now so

### slide 8

<br>`(46:07)` what we will do is we'll take the same
<br>`(46:10)` sloppy but very powerful approach as
<br>`(46:13)` last
<br>`(46:14)` as in the beginning of this lecture
<br>`(46:15)` we'll look at scaling
<br>`(46:17)` arguments now before we do that let's
<br>`(46:20)` quickly have a look at such a simulation
<br>`(46:21)` of such a system
<br>`(46:23)` now between this noise parameter
<br>`(46:27)` here's a 2d system yeah and we tune this
<br>`(46:30)` noise parameter
<br>`(46:31)` on the left hand side if we have a very
<br>`(46:33)` low value of this noise
<br>`(46:35)` you can see that these arrows all point
<br>`(46:38)` more or less in the same direction
<br>`(46:40)` so we have polar order all this
<br>`(46:43)` all this rotational symmetry is broken
<br>`(46:46)` they're all going the same direction if
<br>`(46:49)` we have stronger noise on the right hand
<br>`(46:50)` side then all particles
<br>`(46:52)` are moving in different directions now
<br>`(46:55)` they're
<br>`(46:56)` moving in random directions and if you
<br>`(46:59)` average over these directions
<br>`(47:00)` then the average will be zero
<br>`(47:03)` if your system is large enough
<br>`(47:07)` so this looks like so we just had the
<br>`(47:09)` mermaid rockner theory
<br>`(47:11)` that in it that tells us that in
<br>`(47:13)` equilibrium systems
<br>`(47:14)` you cannot have such order now you
<br>`(47:17)` cannot have alignment of these
<br>`(47:19)` directions
<br>`(47:23)` because perturbations or if somebody
<br>`(47:26)` makes an error
<br>`(47:27)` will grow and travel through the entire
<br>`(47:30)` system and destabilize everything
<br>`(47:32)` apparently here in these kind of systems
<br>`(47:36)` you have a way of transporting
<br>`(47:39)` the alignment information in different
<br>`(47:41)` ways now as we now see
<br>`(47:43)` how these particles manage to talk to
<br>`(47:47)` each other
<br>`(47:48)` over long distances through the entire
<br>`(47:50)` system
<br>`(47:52)` without this information about alignment
<br>`(47:55)` being destroyed
<br>`(47:56)` by noise
<br>`(48:04)` so

### slide 9

<br>`(48:09)` to begin now let's look at the situation
<br>`(48:11)` on the right hand side
<br>`(48:13)` yeah we look at uh
<br>`(48:16)` again these perturbations in these
<br>`(48:18)` angles think about the piles argument
<br>`(48:21)` for example
<br>`(48:22)` now in the first slide we protect the
<br>`(48:24)` system and we look like
<br>`(48:26)` how this perturbation travels through
<br>`(48:29)` the system
<br>`(48:31)` another way to look at this is to look
<br>`(48:33)` at a domain
<br>`(48:35)` of at the reverse question is how
<br>`(48:37)` actually not the perturbation
<br>`(48:38)` now the error propagates but how the
<br>`(48:41)` alignment
<br>`(48:42)` propagates and this is described
<br>`(48:45)` by this w uh w's here
<br>`(48:49)` where we say okay so we have here the
<br>`(48:51)` system
<br>`(48:52)` we have a particle that's moving in some
<br>`(48:54)` direction
<br>`(48:55)` suppose it's locally aligned suppose
<br>`(48:58)` these particles are locally
<br>`(49:00)` going in the same direction now
<br>`(49:03)` then this region here of correlates this
<br>`(49:06)` block
<br>`(49:07)` of particles that are going in the same
<br>`(49:08)` direction roughly the same direction
<br>`(49:11)` now that has a size that is
<br>`(49:14)` perpendicular
<br>`(49:16)` to the direction of the center of mass
<br>`(49:19)` here and that has a size
<br>`(49:23)` that is parallel to it
<br>`(49:26)` now unfortunately i took a circle here
<br>`(49:29)` and i drew a circle
<br>`(49:31)` but of course the point is that these
<br>`(49:33)` directions can be different
<br>`(49:35)` and they will be different so the
<br>`(49:37)` alternative question is how do
<br>`(49:39)` does the information about alignment
<br>`(49:42)` propagate
<br>`(49:43)` through the system
<br>`(49:48)` okay so let's first say
<br>`(49:54)` so suppose that there is a particle and
<br>`(50:03)` and now we have a perturbation yeah
<br>`(50:07)` somebody changes the angle because all
<br>`(50:10)` of these particles are moving
<br>`(50:13)` if you change the angle they will be
<br>`(50:15)` moving into different directions
<br>`(50:19)` yeah and that means
<br>`(50:24)` that
<br>`(50:26)` they get separated over time and the
<br>`(50:29)` separation
<br>`(50:30)` we can write down in these two
<br>`(50:34)` directions parallel and perpendicular
<br>`(50:37)` to the direction of motion of the center
<br>`(50:41)` of mass
<br>`(50:43)` so the perpendicular direction is given
<br>`(50:47)` by some
<br>`(50:48)` velocity times time
<br>`(50:53)` and of course the angle that's the sine
<br>`(50:58)` of delta
<br>`(51:02)` teta yeah that is the deviation
<br>`(51:05)` in the angle
<br>`(51:11)` now the parallel direction just the
<br>`(51:13)` geometric arguments
<br>`(51:17)` is 1 minus cosine of
<br>`(51:20)` delta this is the delta theta
<br>`(51:24)` now it's the cosine of delta tether and
<br>`(51:27)` now we can tailor expand this
<br>`(51:32)` and then this will scale like t times
<br>`(51:37)` delta theta taylor expands the
<br>`(51:40)` cosine and sine and the lowest order in
<br>`(51:43)` the cosine
<br>`(51:45)` is theta squared
<br>`(51:53)` and now so this is the first scaling
<br>`(51:56)` relationship and now we do
<br>`(51:58)` the same thing as before we plug these
<br>`(52:00)` relationships
<br>`(52:01)` into each other all the time until we
<br>`(52:04)` have the exponent
<br>`(52:05)` that we want to know so next step would
<br>`(52:09)` be
<br>`(52:10)` to look at these w's here
<br>`(52:14)` now so that means that we'll be looking
<br>`(52:18)` at the propagation
<br>`(52:24)` of information
<br>`(52:29)` in a volume
<br>`(52:33)` v that scales like
<br>`(52:37)` yeah that is made of these omegas these
<br>`(52:40)` are these w's
<br>`(52:43)` the perpendicular direction to the power
<br>`(52:46)` of d minus one
<br>`(52:48)` dimension times the parallel direction
<br>`(52:52)` all right so you have this red blob here
<br>`(52:54)` some typical
<br>`(52:55)` size and then if you make this a volume
<br>`(52:59)` but you have one parallel direction and
<br>`(53:01)` d minus one
<br>`(53:03)` perpendicular directions
<br>`(53:07)` now and now we look at how these w's
<br>`(53:12)` scale
<br>`(53:16)` now these w's scale
<br>`(53:20)` with delta x perpendicular
<br>`(53:25)` plus some number of spreading
<br>`(53:30)` times the square root of t now that then
<br>`(53:32)` this number we just call
<br>`(53:34)` d perpendicular
<br>`(53:40)` and i can imagine that many of you are
<br>`(53:42)` not angry that you don't know what is
<br>`(53:43)` deep perpendicular
<br>`(53:45)` but that's not the point you have is all
<br>`(53:47)` these pre-factors and so they were all
<br>`(53:49)` they're not interesting to us it's just
<br>`(53:51)` a number
<br>`(53:51)` and we have to write it down because
<br>`(53:54)` it's in this uh
<br>`(53:55)` sum here now it's something
<br>`(53:58)` you know and then we just plug this in
<br>`(54:01)` no
<br>`(54:02)` that's t delta tata
<br>`(54:05)` plus the perpendicular square root of
<br>`(54:08)` tau
<br>`(54:10)` and now we define this
<br>`(54:14)` as t to the gamma
<br>`(54:19)` perpendicular now what just happened
<br>`(54:23)` we wrote down this stuff here
<br>`(54:28)` and we say that you have this delta teta
<br>`(54:32)` here
<br>`(54:32)` you have the perpendicular you have this
<br>`(54:34)` one you have all these components here
<br>`(54:37)` in the long times and over long
<br>`(54:39)` distances
<br>`(54:41)` this has some effective exponent
<br>`(54:45)` gamma perpendicular
<br>`(54:48)` yeah this is the definition of this
<br>`(54:50)` exponent and that's what i use this sign
<br>`(54:53)` for
<br>`(54:55)` now let's look at w
<br>`(54:59)` parallel
<br>`(55:04)` now this will be x parallel
<br>`(55:08)` same thing plus the parallel square root
<br>`(55:12)` of t
<br>`(55:14)` now this scale is like t
<br>`(55:17)` plugging just in plus the parallel
<br>`(55:20)` square root of t and i defined that
<br>`(55:25)` for long times and long distances this
<br>`(55:28)` goes with time to the power of gamma
<br>`(55:32)` parallel again
<br>`(55:35)` gamma parallel is an exponent that we
<br>`(55:38)` want to know
<br>`(55:41)` so gamma parallel and gamma
<br>`(55:43)` perpendicular
<br>`(55:45)` are the exponents that describe how
<br>`(55:48)` these w's on the left-hand side
<br>`(55:51)` how these w's on the left-hand side
<br>`(55:54)` behave
<br>`(55:54)` over long times do they grow do they
<br>`(55:57)` shrink
<br>`(55:58)` do they are diffusive or what yeah so
<br>`(56:00)` that's what
<br>`(56:01)` what's in these gammas here
<br>`(56:04)` and in the end we will calculate these
<br>`(56:06)` gammas here
<br>`(56:08)` and uh we will want to find an
<br>`(56:10)` interpretation
<br>`(56:12)` now let's call these equations
<br>`(56:16)` 1 and 2. we'll use them later
<br>`(56:22)` and now we look at the density of
<br>`(56:24)` fluctuations again
<br>`(56:33)` now this delta tata
<br>`(56:37)` yeah and this like last time
<br>`(56:43)` goes with time times volume
<br>`(56:46)` over volume now that's what we use
<br>`(56:49)` already in the
<br>`(56:50)` pointer whether the static model the
<br>`(56:52)` equilibrium model
<br>`(56:55)` and this i'm just plugging in square
<br>`(56:58)` root of time
<br>`(56:59)` over square root of volume
<br>`(57:02)` and again plugging in square root of
<br>`(57:05)` time
<br>`(57:06)` over now plug in the volume
<br>`(57:12)` omega perpendicular d minus 1
<br>`(57:16)` omega parallel and this we define to be
<br>`(57:20)` our
<br>`(57:21)` third exponent t
<br>`(57:24)` to the gamma you know this is our third
<br>`(57:27)` equation
<br>`(57:31)` now we have all these relationships here
<br>`(57:35)` the answer for for uh for the gammas
<br>`(57:38)` connecting the gammas with something on
<br>`(57:40)` the left hand side
<br>`(57:42)` and again these relationships here these
<br>`(57:44)` different exponent describe different
<br>`(57:45)` things
<br>`(57:46)` that the first two the w's they describe
<br>`(57:49)` how order propagates you know how this
<br>`(57:52)` blob
<br>`(57:52)` how this domain grows or shrinks
<br>`(57:56)` and what you can see already is that it
<br>`(57:59)` will grow or shrink
<br>`(58:01)` differently in the parallel and the
<br>`(58:03)` perpendicular
<br>`(58:04)` and in the parallel direction yeah and
<br>`(58:07)` this density of fluctuation here
<br>`(58:09)` fluctuations that describes let's say
<br>`(58:12)` the opposite thing like the last time
<br>`(58:14)` uh how does an error like a perturbation
<br>`(58:19)` spin that you slip in some other
<br>`(58:20)` direction how does this propagate
<br>`(58:22)` through the entire system
<br>`(58:27)` it now we do

### slide 10

<br>`(58:32)` some algebra now we just plug these in
<br>`(58:36)` to get the exponents now we have three
<br>`(58:39)` equations
<br>`(58:40)` three exponents and what we now do is we
<br>`(58:43)` say
<br>`(58:43)` okay t to the power of one plus gamma
<br>`(58:48)` plus the perpendicular
<br>`(58:51)` times t to the power of 1 over 2
<br>`(58:54)` square root scales like
<br>`(58:59)` t to the power of
<br>`(59:02)` gamma perpendicular
<br>`(59:05)` yeah and from this we can already learn
<br>`(59:09)` that for long times
<br>`(59:14)` this gamma perpendicular will either be
<br>`(59:18)` given by the left hand side yeah
<br>`(59:21)` i've either be given by this or by this
<br>`(59:25)` depending on what is larger
<br>`(59:34)` so this is max
<br>`(59:39)` of one plus gamma one half
<br>`(59:44)` and we can do this uh the other thing
<br>`(59:49)` um we can do the other thing
<br>`(59:52)` also here okay so second equation
<br>`(59:57)` t to the power of 1 plus 2 gamma
<br>`(60:01)` plus the parallel times t
<br>`(60:04)` 1 over 2 is scales like
<br>`(60:08)` t to the power of gamma parallel
<br>`(60:16)` and therefore gamma parallel
<br>`(60:19)` is whatever whichever term on the left
<br>`(60:22)` hand side
<br>`(60:22)` dominates for large values of t
<br>`(60:27)` so that means that this is the maximum
<br>`(60:30)` of 1 plus 2 gamma
<br>`(60:34)` and 1 half and now we have our third
<br>`(60:38)` equation
<br>`(60:40)` our third equation is
<br>`(60:44)` t to the power of one half times just
<br>`(60:47)` plugging in
<br>`(60:49)` t to the power of minus gamma
<br>`(60:52)` perpendicular d minus one over 2
<br>`(60:57)` t to the power of minus gamma
<br>`(61:01)` parallel over 2 and this case like
<br>`(61:05)` t to the gamma and therefore
<br>`(61:11)` we get that solving
<br>`(61:14)` for gamma 2 gamma is equal to
<br>`(61:17)` 1 minus gamma
<br>`(61:21)` perpendicular d minus 1
<br>`(61:24)` minus gamma parallel
<br>`(61:28)` yeah i just count the exponents yeah
<br>`(61:38)` okay now i counted the exponents and now
<br>`(61:41)` i can take these three
<br>`(61:43)` equations here and solve them we have
<br>`(61:46)` three equations
<br>`(61:47)` three unknowns i can just solve them and
<br>`(61:51)` i'll just tell you the results now it's
<br>`(61:54)` school mathematics so that's
<br>`(61:57)` one half minus four times dimension
<br>`(62:04)` one-half half
<br>`(62:08)` so in high dimensions
<br>`(62:11)` information about
<br>`(62:14)` order about interactions or about
<br>`(62:17)` alignment
<br>`(62:18)` is transported in a very inefficient way
<br>`(62:21)` diffusively
<br>`(62:24)` this is this one here and if we go to
<br>`(62:28)` higher dimension
<br>`(62:29)` if we go to lower dimensions and we have
<br>`(62:30)` the case that you see here that is
<br>`(62:33)` another condition
<br>`(62:34)` for where we solve this these equations
<br>`(62:36)` here
<br>`(62:37)` now this gives us conditions that we
<br>`(62:39)` have to distinguish
<br>`(62:41)` there are seven over three smaller than
<br>`(62:43)` d smaller than four
<br>`(62:45)` um then we get
<br>`(62:51)` three minus two d
<br>`(62:54)` over two d
<br>`(62:57)` plus one yeah this will be one half
<br>`(63:02)` and this will be
<br>`(63:06)` um
<br>`(63:10)` five over two
<br>`(63:14)` d plus one no and this is
<br>`(63:18)` the case that we have when we have um
<br>`(63:22)` okay so what we see here already
<br>`(63:25)` in this case is that now in the
<br>`(63:29)` perpendicular direction
<br>`(63:33)` here
<br>`(63:38)` in this perpendicular direction this
<br>`(63:41)` exponent
<br>`(63:42)` is actually larger than one half so that
<br>`(63:45)` means we he
<br>`(63:46)` that means we have super diffusion now
<br>`(63:49)` in other words
<br>`(63:50)` perpendicular to the average direction
<br>`(63:54)` in the block perpendicular to that
<br>`(63:57)` information about alignment is
<br>`(63:59)` transported very efficiently
<br>`(64:02)` it's transported convectively it's not
<br>`(64:04)` diffusing
<br>`(64:05)` diffusion you don't have to talk to all
<br>`(64:08)` of your neighbors you undergo one by one
<br>`(64:10)` but it's
<br>`(64:11)` like it's like convectively it flows
<br>`(64:14)` through the system
<br>`(64:16)` no
<br>`(64:20)` super diffusive
<br>`(64:26)` spread
<br>`(64:29)` of orientation
<br>`(64:35)` information yeah this is actually
<br>`(64:40)` turns out to be a convective
<br>`(64:44)` process now that that this information
<br>`(64:47)` flows
<br>`(64:48)` and not just diffuses now and then we
<br>`(64:51)` have the last case
<br>`(64:53)` yeah d smaller as sorry
<br>`(64:56)` it's already here the last case is
<br>`(65:00)` one minus d over d plus
<br>`(65:04)` three
<br>`(65:07)` five minus d over
<br>`(65:10)` d plus three and four
<br>`(65:14)` over d plus
<br>`(65:17)` three yeah in this case
<br>`(65:20)` actually the alignment information
<br>`(65:26)` is transported super diffusively so very
<br>`(65:29)` efficiently
<br>`(65:30)` both in the parallel direction to the
<br>`(65:33)` flow
<br>`(65:33)` and in the perpendicular direction and
<br>`(65:36)` all of these exponent this cases here
<br>`(65:44)` this exponent is smaller than zero
<br>`(65:48)` now as long as b is larger than one
<br>`(65:51)` larger than one dimensions
<br>`(65:52)` and that means we can expect to have
<br>`(65:56)` long range order
<br>`(66:00)` yeah and now i have to tell you
<br>`(66:02)` something i mean these arguments here
<br>`(66:05)` i don't know if you find that easier
<br>`(66:07)` than the plain mathematics we did in the
<br>`(66:09)` last few lectures
<br>`(66:11)` mathematically they're much easier but
<br>`(66:14)` you have to swallow set the spirit
<br>`(66:16)` of these arguments at some point and
<br>`(66:19)` this is very difficult
<br>`(66:20)` to follow i imagine now that you can
<br>`(66:22)` come up with here
<br>`(66:24)` these kind of things and do them one
<br>`(66:26)` after each other and it somehow works
<br>`(66:28)` out
<br>`(66:28)` every every individual that seems a
<br>`(66:31)` little bit fishy
<br>`(66:32)` no but because you're only interested
<br>`(66:36)` in exponents now we're only interested
<br>`(66:38)` in these gammas here
<br>`(66:40)` and only at very large times yeah from t
<br>`(66:43)` to infinity
<br>`(66:46)` only this is the reason why these
<br>`(66:48)` arguments work so well
<br>`(66:50)` and only for these simulations for the
<br>`(66:52)` physical situations they work well
<br>`(66:54)` and we can actually do that and just
<br>`(66:56)` neglect almost everything and just take
<br>`(66:58)` the highest
<br>`(66:59)` order contributions all the time
<br>`(67:03)` okay so now i have to tell you another
<br>`(67:05)` thing so you can do the same
<br>`(67:06)` arguments vigorously mathematically
<br>`(67:09)` using field theory here
<br>`(67:11)` using renormalization and then you'll
<br>`(67:14)` actually find that
<br>`(67:15)` this situation is more complex than i
<br>`(67:18)` uh made you believe here these puzzles
<br>`(67:21)` are slightly different
<br>`(67:23)` and that in higher dimensions the
<br>`(67:25)` difference between higher
<br>`(67:26)` lower dimensions it's more subtle than i
<br>`(67:28)` may think here
<br>`(67:30)` but for to get a qualitative idea
<br>`(67:33)` of how order is established in these
<br>`(67:37)` non-equilibrium systems uh it works very
<br>`(67:40)` nicely
<br>`(67:41)` and it is an analogy to the icing
<br>`(67:45)` system that i showed you in the building
<br>`(67:46)` you asked what happens to motivation
<br>`(67:49)` how does a perturbation like an error
<br>`(67:51)` spread in the system
<br>`(67:53)` and how does a properly aligned
<br>`(67:56)` domain spread in the system now the
<br>`(67:59)` information about alignment
<br>`(68:02)` this is what we've been looking here and

### slide 11

<br>`(68:06)` just to summarize i think that the point
<br>`(68:09)` that we get so i told you there's no
<br>`(68:10)` general theory about how order is
<br>`(68:13)` established in non-equivalent systems
<br>`(68:16)` but the point we get here is the
<br>`(68:19)` following
<br>`(68:20)` now it says the two forces
<br>`(68:24)` that determine whether you have order or
<br>`(68:25)` not and these are interactions
<br>`(68:28)` and noise and
<br>`(68:31)` the balance between these two will
<br>`(68:33)` decide how internet interaction
<br>`(68:35)` information
<br>`(68:37)` how far interaction information can
<br>`(68:38)` propagate through the system
<br>`(68:40)` and whether you're able to establish to
<br>`(68:43)` communicate
<br>`(68:44)` between a large number of
<br>`(68:47)` elements and make them align in the same
<br>`(68:50)` direction
<br>`(68:52)` so what we need is that these
<br>`(68:53)` perturbations or these fluctuations
<br>`(68:55)` these errors
<br>`(68:57)` that it should decay sufficiently fast
<br>`(69:00)` or
<br>`(69:00)` vice versa this information on alignment
<br>`(69:04)` now this communicating your direction
<br>`(69:07)` should uh propagate fast enough or far
<br>`(69:10)` enough
<br>`(69:12)` now in equilibrium we've seen that you
<br>`(69:14)` have a fixed number of neighbors
<br>`(69:17)` and if you have that then you share
<br>`(69:20)` information in a very slow way
<br>`(69:22)` diffusively and
<br>`(69:25)` then in equilibrium you're not able to
<br>`(69:29)` arrange long
<br>`(69:30)` long range order because you can always
<br>`(69:32)` destabilize it very easily
<br>`(69:35)` out of equilibrium our neighbors can
<br>`(69:37)` change now we're not only
<br>`(69:39)` not always surrounded by the same
<br>`(69:41)` neighbors but if we have
<br>`(69:43)` little anger to our neighbors then this
<br>`(69:46)` neighbor transports our alignment
<br>`(69:49)` information to other parts of the system
<br>`(69:52)` and this is most prominent at a
<br>`(69:55)` perpendicular direction to where we're
<br>`(69:57)` going
<br>`(69:58)` and this alignment information cannot
<br>`(70:01)` only flow
<br>`(70:02)` diffusively like in these equilibrium
<br>`(70:04)` systems but because we have now this
<br>`(70:06)` non-equilibrium component the active
<br>`(70:09)` movement
<br>`(70:10)` of these particles it can be transported
<br>`(70:13)` convectively that means it can flow
<br>`(70:17)` through the entire system uh like a
<br>`(70:20)` transport
<br>`(70:21)` process yeah and with this uh these
<br>`(70:23)` these non-equilibrium systems order can
<br>`(70:25)` emerge
<br>`(70:26)` and be can emerge although in similar
<br>`(70:29)` systems you cannot
<br>`(70:30)` have long-range order due to the merman
<br>`(70:33)` world theory
<br>`(70:36)` okay great so i hope i helped we got a
<br>`(70:39)` first
<br>`(70:39)` idea so so because we don't have a
<br>`(70:42)` rigorous theory of
<br>`(70:43)` everything in non-equilibrium system i
<br>`(70:45)` think the important
<br>`(70:47)` point is to get into intuition
<br>`(70:50)` with simple arguments about how order
<br>`(70:54)` can emerge and what are the components
<br>`(70:57)` that are competing with each other
<br>`(71:00)` that decide in in the end whether you
<br>`(71:02)` get order or not
<br>`(71:04)` and this idea that we had at the
<br>`(71:06)` beginning about the piles argument is
<br>`(71:08)` actually a very powerful idea that is
<br>`(71:10)` very useful
<br>`(71:11)` even when thinking about non-equilibrium
<br>`(71:14)` systems
<br>`(71:16)` so with this i'm done for today
<br>`(71:20)` and uh
<br>`(71:24)` see you all next time so i think i think
<br>`(71:26)` i think some of you might have some
<br>`(71:28)` questions
<br>`(71:28)` regarding the uh scaling arguments
<br>`(71:32)` so if you have some questions of what we
<br>`(71:34)` can do is that
<br>`(71:35)` i can send you some papers or just send
<br>`(71:39)` me an email and send you some
<br>`(71:40)` some papers or some some some text of
<br>`(71:43)` where these
<br>`(71:44)` arguments are done in detail
<br>`(71:47)` and uh so that you can use get used to
<br>`(71:50)` them and that you can see
<br>`(71:52)` how they actually work really and why
<br>`(71:54)` they work
<br>`(71:56)` you know and um the mathematics behind
<br>`(71:59)` these arguments
<br>`(72:00)` is actually as you've seen in school
<br>`(72:02)` mathematics
<br>`(72:03)` you know if you can have an exponent of
<br>`(72:06)` something you already know but
<br>`(72:08)` you know enough mathematics for this
<br>`(72:10)` lecture
<br>`(72:12)` okay thanks a lot so i'll stay online in
<br>`(72:14)` case there are questions
<br>`(72:15)` and i think there's at least one
<br>`(72:17)` questions about by matthew
<br>`(72:19)` and for the rest of you see you all next
<br>`(72:21)` week yeah and sorry to those who i
<br>`(72:23)` did reply to an email yes i was had a
<br>`(72:26)` very busy inbox this week
